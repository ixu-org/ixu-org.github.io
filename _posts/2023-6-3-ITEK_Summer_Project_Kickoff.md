## Project Overview

This project is the first stage in a three-part implementation, with the goal to establish an infrastructure system with the capabilities as follows:

- Project portfolio site (Github Pages, Jekyll)
- Network infrastructure (Cisco Catalyst, Aironet, vWLC)
- Event monitoring, metrics collection (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Local network-level services (Pi-hole, Unbound, Guacamole)
- Documentation (Confluence)
- Issue tracking (Jira)

## Technologies and Tools

This project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools, including:

- Cisco vWLC
- RADIUS Authentication
- SNMP Protocol
- Docker Containers
- Ubuntu Server

## Project Stage Progression

The project is divided into three stages:

1. Infrastructure Setup and Service Implementation: Establishing the fundamental network infrastructure and setting up key services.
2. Building Up: Introducing complex configurations and integrations, enhancing network services, strengthening security, and starting integrating cloud services.
3. Advanced Technologies and Performance Optimization: Implementing advanced technologies and services, as well as performance optimization.

## Deliverables

The deliverables of this project include:

- Proprietary configuration files
- Diagrams & Documentations
- Deployment scripts
- Container configuration files
- Charted metrics
- Project portfolio
- Reports

## Budget

"At this rate, I foresee the only deficit in my budget being not fiscal, but mental."

## Timeline & Review Process

The project timeline is from 31 May 2023 to 7 Jul 2023, with the deliverables due date on 14 Jul 2023.
