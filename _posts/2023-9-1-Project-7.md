# Introduction to the History and Mechanics of TCP/IP

---

While the Internet evolved as an indispensable tool for large institutions and governmental organizations, rapid advancements in data communication technologies unfolded.

>The technological practices and the use of networked communications were not an unfamiliar concept for the time. Rudimentary implementations of electrical data exchange were first introduced with the early telegraphs, which encoded the information into a transmittable medium, then later with telephones with their manual and automated circuit-switching.

## A Pioneering Venture: ARPANET and Its Inception

The initial concept for a fault-tolerant, decentralized network system for communication was brought forward by the U.S. Department of Defense in the early to mid-1960s. Thereafter, theoretical research into distributed communication technology proceeded rapidly and derived crucial insight from notable research papers such as J.C.R. Licklider’s seminal paper "Man-Computer Symbiosis" (1960) and a later one entitled "The Computer as a Communication Device" (1968) which he had co-written with Robert W. Taylor.

**RFQ and Contract Award**: The formal Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the ARPANET was initiated in July of 1968 by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Interested companies would evaluate and propose their manufacturing and R&D specialties (Research and Development). The contract was awarded to Bolt, Beranek, and Newman Inc. (BBN) in 1969 upon impressing the evaluation committee with their technical prowess and their prior experience with digital time-sharing systems.  

Not long after, first solid proof of concept and a working prototype was successfully tested at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) with their existing host computer Sigma 7 and BBN’s packed switching node “IMP” (Interface Message Processor). This would be the first entry into standardization and centralization of interconnected “things”.

### Realization of a Vision and Network Expansion

Collaborative work between multiple academic institutions and the now contracted highly skilled pioneers of BBN would see the goal of achieving a major developmental leap towards actualizing Licklider’s vision, which served as an early architectural framework that evolved into what is now contemporarily referred to as “Cloud Computing”.

Initiated in 1970, ARPAnet's transformative potential gained recognition across the United States, leading to an expansive array of interconnected hardware infrastructure.
