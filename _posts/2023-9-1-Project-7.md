# Introduction to the History and Mechanics of TCP/IP

---

While the Internet evolved as an indispensable tool for large institutions and governmental organizations, rapid advancements in data communication technologies unfolded.

>The technological practices and the use of networked communications were not an unfamiliar concept for the time. Rudimentary implementations of electrical data exchange were first introduced with the early telegraphs, which encoded the information into a transmittable medium, then later with telephones with their manual and automated circuit-switching.

## A Pioneering Venture: ARPANET and Its Inception

The initial concept for a fault-tolerant, decentralized network system for communication was brought forward by the U.S. Department of Defense in the early to mid-1960s. Thereafter, theoretical research into distributed communication technology proceeded rapidly and derived crucial insight from notable research papers such as J.C.R. Licklider’s seminal paper "Man-Computer Symbiosis" (1960) and a later one entitled "The Computer as a Communication Device" (1968) which he had co-written with Robert W. Taylor.

**RFQ and Contract Award**: The formal Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the ARPANET was initiated in July of 1968 by the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Interested companies would evaluate and propose their manufacturing and R&D specialties (Research and Development). The contract was awarded to Bolt, Beranek, and Newman Inc. (BBN) in 1969 upon impressing the evaluation committee with their technical prowess and their prior experience with digital time-sharing systems.  

Not long after, first solid proof of concept and a working prototype was successfully tested at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) with their existing host computer Sigma 7 and BBN’s packed switching node “IMP” (Interface Message Processor). This would be the first entry into standardization and centralization of interconnected “things”.

### Realization of a Vision and Network Expansion  

</div>

#### Licklider's Vision and Academic Collaboration

Collaborative work between multiple academic institutions and the now contracted highly skilled pioneers of BBN would see the goal of achieving a major developmental leap towards actualizing Licklider’s vision, which served as an early architectural framework that evolved into what is now contemporarily referred to as “Cloud Computing”.  

#### ARPANet's Inception and NCP's Role (1969-1970)

Initiated between late 1969 and early 1970, ARPAnet's transformative potential gained recognition across the United States, leading to an expansive array of interconnected hardware infrastructure.  
From its early inception, the Network Control Protocol (NCP) was developed to address the urgent requirement for standardized communication methods.  

This provided a base transport layer of the protocol stack, being responsible for packet transportation between two communicating host systems.  




#### Initial Success and Subsequent Limitations (Post-1970)

> *Locations of the 4 initial nodes.*  
At that point, the type of data was reasonably simple, mostly consisting of internal messages and small sets of data.

#### Stateless Design Pitfall

However, as the network grew in complexity and began to cover additional nodes aswell as their respective networks, several issues arose:

- **Scaling Challenges**: Increasing distances and node counts rapidly highlighted NCP's limitations.
  
- **Content-Type Evolution**: New types of content began stressing NCP's capabilities, exposing its shortcomings.

- **Noise and Scalability**: The protocol’s susceptibility to noise and scalability constraints became evident as the network grew beyond the original four nodes on the west coast.
- **Reliability and Error Handling**: NCP had no end-to-end error control mechanisms, meaning that any packet loss or errors during transmission would lead to an immediate collapse of the NCP session, rendering the connection to the host computer unusable until manual restoration would take place.  


By design, NCP was a stateless communication protocol, eliminating the possibility for either party to verify the successful transmission and arrival of packets at their intended destinations. Erroneously received packets would cause
Albeit, NCP did have some “stateful” features concerning the initial connection’s handshake up to the point of stating the start of an emitted datastream.

> *Host-to-host communication using NCP.*  

Furthermore, when a computer tried to connect to ARPAnet that was outside the preregistered node, would the network protocol cause that specific system’s networking functionality to fail. This was due to NCP’s inherently rigid design, which did not take in account unregistered acting nodes not residing in predefined networks.   

### The Advent of TCP and the Ideological Shift to Open Architecture Networking  
As multitude of industries started shifting towards standardization of technologies, would it permit more free collaborative work between separate R&D entities to effectively overcome technological shortcoming in an unforeseen pace. This transformation in return reinforced the emphasis of interoperability between technologies, and
